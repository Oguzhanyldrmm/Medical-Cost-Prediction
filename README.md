# Medical-Cost-Prediction
This is a machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict medical costs based on certain attributes of patients.
The dataset used for this project is the Medical Cost Personal Datasets from Kaggle, which includes information on patients such as age, gender, BMI, smoker status, and region, as well as their corresponding medical costs.
This project will be implemented in Python, using popular machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
